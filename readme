In this repository i will put my config files for improving it, and sharing.
Programs needed to work it.
ZSH: If it wasn't enought obvious.
gawk: Used in some alias and functions
recode: recoding UNIX2DOS and DOS2UNIX.
manpages-es, manpages-es-extra: (optional, but remember to change man alias, in .zaliases).
htop: I prefer it, instead of normal top, change alias (top,mytop) in .zaliases if you don't want it.
most: I use it for pager.
git: Obviously no?
rar,unrar,unace, ncompress, bunzip2, gunzip,p7zip-full: If you don't have it.
