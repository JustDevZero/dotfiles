# I've found that they're all nice in their nice ways, but I still don't use
# them, thus defeating the purpose of a todo list.

# All `todo` does is put a file on my Desktop with the filename given. That's
# it. I aggressively prune my desktop of old tasks and keep one or two on there
# at a time. Once I've finished a todo, I just delete the file. That's it.
